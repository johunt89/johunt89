ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jordan

ðŸ“„ About Me:</summary>
I spent many years with a successful career in retail management.  During the pandemic the line of work changed drastically and I decided it was time for me to make a career change.  Computers have always been a big interest and hobby for me.  I have always been interested in how things work.  When MySpace was the big social media thing I found myself digging in to figure out how to have the coolest looking profile possible (I was really cool). After graduating from college the first time I spent many years managing hardware & software repair businesses. I think with my work experience and knowledge I have a unique perspective that will enable me to be succssful in my transition to a new career.
 
 <br/><br/>
 
 I have a Business diploma and I am currently a Computer Progamming and Analysis (co-op) student who expects to graduate with honours in 2023.
